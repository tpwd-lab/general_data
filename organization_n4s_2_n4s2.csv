Even though WiLDAF functions as a multi-regional/transnational organization, it pays close attention to the economical, social and historical differences between states and countries. </p><p>This organization grew out of the \""women's rights as human rights\"" movement, as a more assertive claim to rights for women than the previous rhetoric of \""needs\"". </p><p>WiLDAF centers around the principle that equality and empowerment are essential to a healthy society, and they focus their efforts on development and the law in relation to women to advocate for and educate people. They believe that empowering women through education, workshops, communication and outreach around development and law is extremely valuable. In addition, they work at national and regional levels to spur institutional planning, development and building international connections for added support. The organization also provides aid in the case of a violation of women's rights by providing Emergency Response Systems and facilitating centers for women who have been abused psychologically, physically or morally (and in such cases can shelter the woman and help her to take legal action) </p><strong>History </strong><p>Women in Law &amp; Development in Africa was established in February 1990 during a regional conference in Harare, Zimbabwe (with the theme of \""Women, right and development: network for empowerment in Africa\"") as a result of 6 women coming together with the idea for a pan-African organization after attending the World Women's Conference held in Nairobi, 1985. This forum was also instrumental in the creation of WiLDAF because issues around women's rights became the topic of debate for the many African women participating in the forum. </p><p>The World Women's Conference was where the ideas around \""women's rights as human rights\"" became a topic of debate. </p><p>Another notable point in the origin of WiLDAF was where humanitarian organizations lobbied for the formal recognition of woman's rights during the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna 1993. </p><p>An additional conference that furthered the \""women's rights as human rights\"" movement was the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, where this movement was further defined. As well as providing a topic of debate around women's rights as human rights, the conference also spurred debate about empowerment through law. </p><p>The three aforementioned meetings were sponsored by the \""Women in Law and Development\"" project by a US donor agency called OEF International. OEF International facilitated the growth of regional networks of organizations to combine their efforts and work at local levels to spread education and information around women's rights issues. In addition to WiLDAF, OEF International supported the formation of Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) as well as the Comité de América Latina y El Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer (CLADEM) in Latin America and the Caribbean. </p><strong>Structure </strong><p>WiLDAF's head office is located in Harare, Zimbabwe. As a transnational organization, WiLDAF contains national offices as well as local offices in specific regions; in certain regions local WiLDAF Advisory Committees and representatives function instead of local offices where there are none. WiLDAF's meetings, agendas and decision-making are built on a \""from the ground-up\"" philosophy around structure which begins at the local level and continues through to larger and larger structures including country, regional and international. Member individuals and organizations are involved at many steps of decision-making and meetings. Surveys and reports are often part of meetings (see below \""Surveys\""). WiLDAF hold their General Assembly every few years to plan and prioritize for the future, reaffirm and add to their objectives as well as celebrate accomplishments.<sup><a>[4]</a></sup> </p><strong>Aims and goals </strong><p>WiLDAF grew out of the movement called <strong>\""women's rights as human rights\""</strong>, which emphasizes that rights can be lobbied for, enforced and monitored as opposed to the language of \""needs\"". It also moves away from manifestos and demands present in earlier feminist discourse. Furthermore, Human rights does not take the standard as the rights of \""men\"", therefore organizations can better address the reproductive, maternity, gender-based discrimination and domestic violence needs that women require. This movement advocated for women's rights in all spheres, including promoting private affairs to be under lawful scrutiny (such as domestic violence) in regions which traditionally separate the private and public domains and as a result call to reform \""family law\"".A distinction between the \""private\"" and the \""public\"" is made here as \""private\"" laws tend to affect women in particular due to the fact that women tend to be relegated there by societal expectations. The private is also traditionally (whether culturally, regionally or religiously) the place where the state does not extend, and therefore provides multi-layered hurdles for advocacy actions. \""Women's rights as human rights\"" is a movement to claim the rights women have and to empower women through education and an interconnectivity of local and global spheres. An aspect of the \""woman's rights as human rights\"" movement that remains in the aims of WiLDAF is an inter-connectivity between both local and global efforts to empower women through law and development as discussed below. Communication between all facets of WiLDAF as well as local through to international communication is a main aim of the organization as they believe that transparent communication allows umbrella organizations and WiLDAF members to learn from one an others experiences. </p><br>""",https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/organizations/women-in-law-development-in-africa,99083a118bbd1b6fa9f8101c35d244db

3828,o-66ce39d43b,,The Kokang Militia Force (KMF),Ethnic armed organization,2017-05-30,"""<p>The Kokang Militia Force (KMF), a Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces)-supported community militia, has been emerging in the conflict-torn Kokang Self-Administered Zone. This is a fresh and tricky security development in the China-Myanmar border areas, which have become more and more militarized as a result of the Tatmadaw’s offensives across the ethnic areas since 2009.</p><p>The Kokang region (782 square miles) is located in the northern part of Myanmar’s Shan State, with the Salween river to its west, and southwestern China’s Yunnan province to the east. This area is mostly populated by Kokang people, a Han Chinese group which belongs to the 135 taingyintha (national races) officially recognised by the Myanmar government. Since 2015, Kokang has been intermittently hit by deadly clashes between the Tatmadaw and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) which is led, if not directly, by Kokang’s former leader Peng Jiasheng, who was ousted by the junta in 2009.</p><p>On October 30th, the KMF was ceremonially issued weapons by Colonel Kyaw Kyaw Tun, the acting commander of the Laukai Regional Operation Command (ROC). He said, “The militias in this country have been fighting together with the Tatmadaw for several decades. Now the Kokang militia has been successfully rebuilt into four standard units, waiting for the final approval from our superiors.”</p><p>The community militias controlled directly by local Tatmadaw troops are part of a strategic arrangement that began in the 1960s, under the doctrine of people’s war: an emphasis on the participation of the population in combating both domestic insurgents and foreign threats . At that time, the “godfather of heroin”, Luo Xinghan (a.k.a. Lo Hsing Han) started his opium-trafficking career in Kokang as the chief of a Ka Kwe Ye (home guard) unit, a local militia set up to fight the communists.</p><p>The issue of militias has only received occasional attention in Myanmar scholarship. John Buchanan has taken a systematic look at militias and their roles in economy, politics, conflict as well as the communities in which they operate. In a research report, titled “Militias in Myanmar”, published by the Asia Foundation last year, Buchanan disaggregated the Tatmadaw-affiliated militias into three types, namely, Tatmadaw-integrated militias, Tatmadaw non-integrated militias and Tatmadaw-supported community militias. The KMF fits into the third group which is “ made up of civilians recruited from a community, trained and armed by the Tatmadaw.”</p><p>Buchanan also notes that the “Tatmadaw-supported community militias ... are part of the Tatmadaw’s national defense strategy. When necessary, the Tatmadaw may mobilize this type of militia to fight against foreign and local threats.”</p><p>Undoubtedly, all the “foreign and local threats” to the KMF will be posed by the the MNDAA, which has fully taken advantage of the porous China-Myanmar border to attack selected targets inside the Kokang region, including hotels (November 27th, 2015), houses (September 15th, 2016) and casinos (March 6th, 2017) owned by rivals in the Kokang community who are loyal to the Myanmar government. These rivals strongly support the KMF, bearing the vast majority of the financial burden, while the local government provides monthly subsidies equivalent to $76 per person.</p><p>One of the Kokang KMF’s four authorized units, with approximately 200 well-trained cadres, is headed by Bai Yingcang, the second son of the Kokang SAZ former top leader Bai Suocheng (2009-2016) (a.k.a. Bai Xuoqian). Bai Suocheng boldly challenged his superior Peng Jiasheng’s rule and became loyal to the then-SPDC government in the historic “88 Incident”, a violent conflict that erupted 8 years ago, leading to Peng Jiasheng’s “eighth fall” and the Tatmadaw incumbent Commander-in-Chief senior general Min Aung Hlaing’s prominent rise.</p>""",https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/organizations/the-kokang-militia-force,4fbe0a86a230ae95c8d745b426b4e3f8

3852,o-4c7fd242e3,,National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (NCCCP),Political party,,"""<p>The National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party is a party congress that is held every five years. The National Congress is theoretically the highest body within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Since 1987 the National Congress has been held in the months of October or November. The venue for the event, beginning in 1956, is the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The Congress is the public venue for top-level leadership changes in the CCP and the formal event for changes to the Party's Constitution. In the past two decades the National Congress of the CCP has been pivotal at least as a symbolic part of leadership changes, and therefore has gained international media attention.</p><p>The Congress formally approves the membership of the Central Committee, a body composed of the top decision-makers in the party, state, and society. In practice, however, only slightly more candidates than open seats are nominated for the Central Committee, limiting the Congress's role in the selection process to eliminating very unpopular candidates. Each five-year cycle of the National People's Congress also has a series of plenums of the Central Committee which since the mid-1990s have been held more or less regularly once every year.</p><p>From the mid-1980s to the late-2010s, the CCP has attempted to maintain a smooth and orderly succession and avoiding a cult of personality, by having a major shift in personnel every ten years in even number party congresses, and by promoting people in preparation for this shift in odd number party congresses. In addition, as people at the top level of the party retire, there is room for younger members of the party to move up one level. Hence the party congress is a time of a general personnel reshuffle, and the climax of negotiations that involve not only the top leadership but practically all significant political positions in China. Because of the pyramid structure of the party and the existence of mandatory retirement ages, cadres who are not promoted at a party congress are likely to face the end of their political careers.</p><p>Similar to the practice of the NPC, the delegates to the Congress are formally selected from grassroots party organizations, and like the NPC, there is a system of staggered elections in which one level of the party votes for the delegates to the next higher level. For the National Congress, delegates are elected by the CCP's provincial level party congresses or their equivalent units in a selection process that is screened and supervised by the party's Organization Department as directed by the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC).</p>""",https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/organizations/national-congress-of-the-chinese-communist-party-ncccp,70f187b16bb7f6a49db815921020a7e2

The CMC is the chief conduit through which the military can influence China’s leadership and vice versa. The CMC’s two Vice Chairs have seats on the Politburo. Wikipedia says the CMC “issues directives relating to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), including senior appointments, troop deployments and arms spending.” The CMC shares authority over the People’s Armed Police (PAP) with the Ministry of Public Security.</p><p>In October 2017 the Central Military Commission was cut from 10 military leaders (plus Xi), down to six and in November 2017 a new guideline was issued by the CMC calling for total loyalty to Xi Jinping. According to a Xinhua report, the armed forces should be “absolutely loyal, honest and reliable to Xi”. A song titled “Be a good soldier for Chairman Xi” was released by the People’s Armed Police on the same occasion.</p><p>Xi Jinping’s “anti-graft” campaign has already brought down 100 Generals. One of those promoted to the CMC in 2017, Zhang Shengmin, is the chief of the CMC’s Discipline Inspection Commission, which suggests that the campaign is still a priority.</p><p>The military has seen a massive restructuring in recent years, creating 15 new departments. Xi Jinping’s corruption crackdown saw the expulsion from the Party of former CMC Vice Chair Xu Caihou and changes in the leadership of the People’s Armed Police (now led by General Wang Ning). In July 2015 another former CMC Vice Chair, General Guo Boxiang, was expelled from the Party and handed over for court martial. One day later, Xi Jinping promoted a further 10 military leaders to the rank of General. These included four that had Tibet experience.</p><p>In the run-up to the 50th Anniversary of the founding of the “Tibet Autonomous Region” (September 2015) two members of the Central Military Commission visited the TAR: Vice Chair General Zu Qiliang and General Zhang Yang.</p><p>In April 2013, according to the South China Morning Post, Xi Jinping ordered PLA generals and senior officers to serve as low ranking soldiers for at least two weeks, as a measure designed to “shake up the military and boost morale”.</p><p>According to Willy Lam the PLA is currently dominated by princelings (offspring of former leaders, a clique to which Xi Jinping also belongs) while Hu’s Communist Youth League clique is under-represented. Analysts STRATFOR, writing about the 2012 power handover: “The military’s influence over China’s politics and policies has grown over the past decade, as the country has striven to professionalize and modernize its forces and expand its capabilities in response to deepening international involvement and challenges to its internal stability. Fifth generation military leaders...will take office at a time when the military’s budget, stature and influence over politics is growing..., and sees its role as extending to becoming a guide for the country as it moves forward and up the ranks of international power.”</p>""",https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/organizations/the-central-military-commission,f5b56718a23d725da488d26bb9684e3b

The current presidential cabinet is the Onward Indonesia Cabinet of Joko Widodo.</p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>The concept of a cabinet is not mentioned explicitly in the 1945 Constitution, so Indonesia's cabinets since 14 November 1945 are the result of administrative convention. There have been two types of cabinet in Indonesian history; presidential and parliamentary. In presidential cabinets, the president is responsible for government policy as head of state and government, while in parliamentary cabinets, the cabinet carries out government policy, and is responsible to the legislature.</p><p>During the War of Independence from 1945 to 1949, the cabinet changed from a presidential to a parliamentary system, despite this not being the system intended by those who drew up the Constitution; however, at several critical periods, it reverted to a presidential system. During this period, the cabinet had between 16 and 37 ministers with 12-15 ministries.</p><p>On 27 December 1949, the Netherlands recognized the sovereignty of the United States of Indonesia (RIS). Under the Federal Constitution of 1949, the RIS had a parliamentary cabinet as ministers were responsible for government policy. With the return to the unitary state of Indonesia in August 1950, the parliamentary cabinet system remained due to an agreement between the governments of the RIS and the Republic of Indonesia (a constituent of the RIS). Article 83 of the Provisional Constitution of 1950 stated that ministers had full responsibility for government policy. Over the following nine years there were seven cabinets with between 18 and 25 members.</p><p>On 5 July 1959, President Sukarno issued a decree abrogating the 1950 Constitution and returning to the 1945 Constitution. The cabinet was also dissolved. A new presidential cabinet was formed shortly after, but this new cabinet did not follow the 1945 Constitution either, as the office of prime minister still existed, along with deputy prime ministers. Moreover, the offices of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indonesia and Speaker of the People's Representative Council which were supposed to be equal to the president, and the office of Chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly, which was supposed to be above all government branches, were included into the Cabinet. During the final years of Sukarno's presidency, cabinets were larger, peaking at 111 ministers.</p><p>During the New Order under President Suharto, cabinets were smaller, and from 1968 until 1998 lasted for the five-year presidential term. Offices that were not sanctioned by the 1945 Constitution were abolished. Following the fall of Suharto and the beginning of the Reformasi era, the presidential cabinet system has been retained.</p><p>Until 2010, cabinet ministries were dubbed 'Departments' (Departemen) following the United States model. After 2010, all 'departements' were renamed into 'ministries' (Kementerian), thus bringing them in line with the Netherlands model of ministries and a state secretariat.<br></p>""",https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/organizations/indonesia-cabinet-members,b1b45ff50374662f27614abe03c99e37

By way of background, in July 2020, the Minister of Economy and Finance put forward the draft Law on Management of Commercial Gaming (“Draft Law”) before the plenary session of the Council of Ministers presided by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia for consideration and approval. The Council of Ministers subsequently approved the Draft Law and tabled the same before the National Assembly and the Senate for their respective adoption. This piece of legislation has been in the works for nine years and is the result of inter-ministerial expertise as well as public and private contributions.</p><p><strong>Key Features of the Law:</strong></p><p>The Law has cleared up many doubts relating to activities of the commercial gaming industry. The Law consists of 12 Chapters and 97 Articles which are believed to serve as a solid and effective governing foundation for the Cambodian commercial gaming industry going forward.</p><p><u>I. Scope of the Law</u></p><p>The Law intends to provide comprehensive management of integrated resorts and commercial gaming businesses by strengthening institutional capacity, introducing guidelines and procedures for the management of integrated resorts and commercial games as well as setting out rights and obligations for operators of the gaming industry. </p><p>The Law governs all kinds of commercial games including, but not limited to, casino games, luck-based games, betting games and other games pursued for monetary benefits or the equivalent thereof by the players. The Law does not govern games that do not involve pursuit of monetary benefits or the equivalent thereof.</p><p><em>In addition, the Law categorises commercial games into three types:</em><br></p><p><strong>1. Casino games:</strong> games that are allowed to be played inside a casino and include poker, blackjack, baccarat, roulette, slot machine and/or other games that use cards, dice, mechanical equipment, electromechanics or electronic equipment and/or equipment and/or other games determined by the Commercial Games Commission of Cambodia (“CGCC”). Casino games do not include betting games, luck-based games, and other commercial games.</p><p><strong>2. Luck-based games:</strong> games that take place outside of a casino vicinity which rely solely or partly on luck, combined with the players’ dexterity in the game. Examples are lottery and/or other games as may be determined by CGCC.</p><p><strong>3. Betting games:</strong> games that rely upon prediction of certain competition or events.</p><p><u>II. CGCC as Regulator</u><br></p><p>With the introduction of the Law, CGCC will also be established as a supervising authority for all activities within the commercial gaming industry of Cambodia. Its functions include, but not limited to the following:</p><ul><li>Proposing new regulations (Prakas and other sub-regulations) and development policy, and deciding on the necessary forms and procedures for public service for integrated resorts and commercial gaming businesses;</li><li>Granting licenses for commercial gaming entities and related activities;</li><li>Issuing specific guidelines from time to time; and</li><li>Offering dispute resolution as vested by this Law.</li></ul><p><u>III. Zoning</u></p><p>Recognising the Royal Government of Cambodia’s concerns over the negative impact of the commercial gaming industry vis-a-vis Cambodia’s important cultural and traditional values, the Law addresses questions relating to locations of future commercial gaming businesses. Under Article 19, a clear mechanism will be introduced via a Sub-Decree on the zoning of commercial gaming businesses. Essentially, the zoning is categorised into two: (1) Prohibited zone and (2) Permitted zone.</p><p><u>IV. Licensing Regime</u></p><p>The Law sets out a comprehensive foundation for future activities of the Cambodian gaming industry. The Law introduces the following licenses for commercial gaming businesses:</p><ul><li>Casino games;</li><li>Betting games;</li><li>Luck-based games; and</li><li>Other commercial games.</li></ul><p>The Law further provides a licensing regime for persons engaged in other related operations such as:<br></p><ul><li>Special employees;</li><li>Promoters (junkets); and</li><li>Manufacturers, installers, importers, sellers and/or distributors of equipment and/or gaming software.</li></ul><p>The licensing regime and requirements (including minimum capital requirements) will be determined in regulations to be issued subsequently</p><p><u>V. Restrictions on Players</u></p><p>The Law puts to rest questions on player eligibility with the following restrictions:</p><ul><li>Individuals who are mentally incompetent, financially incompetent or declared bankrupt;</li><li>Individuals who are intoxicated or addicted to drugs;</li><li>Individuals who are armed;</li><li>Minors (under 18 years of age);</li><li>Cambodian citizens including armed forces, public officials and elected citizens; and</li><li>Employees of the gaming establishments where the gambling activities take place.</li></ul><p><u>VI. Tax Obligations</u></p><p>Integrated resorts, casino operators and/or owners are subject to the following revenue obligations for the period of possession of their licences:</p><p>a. Casinos located inside integrated resorts are subject to 4 % for the VIP segment and 7% for mass-market guests.</p><p>b. Casinos located outside of the integrated resorts are subject to a flat 7% rate.</p><p>The basis for the calculation of revenue obligation is the total revenue from all the gambling activities of the casino minus winnings of the guests. Revenue obligations concerning betting games, luck-based games and other commercial games will be determined by a Prakas to be subsequently issued by the Minister of Economy and Finance.</p>""",https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/organizations/commercial-gambiling-management-commission-of-cambodia,895439de5c19fc24bf23d5929758030b
3955,o-1032f5ce25,,Forever Associates Zimbabwe,Government agency,2010-01-01,"""<p>FAZ is not a constitutional or official arrangement, but an underground operational unit campaigning for Mnangagwa and Zanu PF in the August 2023 general elections. As a result, Faz has now displaced the army’s structure called Heritage that used to perform a similar role and other functions. In 2018, the army ran elections through Heritage and Africom, a converged communication service provider.</p><p>Sources say, so far, Faz has received US$10 million and 200 cars to run its affairs in preparation for elections. More resources have been promised to capacitate the secret structure. Faz’s mandate, working together with the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission and its chair Priscilla Chigumba, is to coordinate logistics and decisive forces to retain Mnangagwa in power.</p><p>Faz, which is a CIO structure, has taken over the running of elections within Zanu PF and nationally. It is run by Walter Tapfumaneyi and is answerable to the President. The army and CIO have ongoing fierce rivalry which heightened during the coup in 2017. One CIO senior officer, Peter Munetsi, was killed by the army during the coup. </p><p>Informed sources said Faz was given the mandate to run the electoral process and elections behind-the-scenes to ensure Mnangagwa and Zanu PF wins.</p><p> This means it liaises with Zanu PF, government institutions and electoral agencies on behalf of Mnangagwa and his party to ensure things go right and they win.</p><p>This is largely informed by the need to counter a growing fear of “bhora musango” or internal sabotage.</p><p>Although it is not a constitutional government body but a CIO operational structure, Faz is funded through state resources. It was given US$10 million in public funds, 200 cars and a number of CIO officers to coordinate its activities to run elections for Mnangagwa and Zanu PF. Its personnel are secretly paid in United States dollars outside the official government payroll.</p><p>Tapfumaneyi, a retired brigadier-general, runs Faz and reports directly to Mnangagwa.<br>As part of election campaigns, Faz has already sent out a large contingent of security operatives to the ground across the country to mobilise votes for Mnangagwa and Zanu PF.</p><p>az was involved in the recent controversial Zanu PF primary elections. Norton Independent MP Temba Mliswa publicly exposed the role of Faz in the Zanu PF primaries where his sister Mary Mliswa-Chikoka lost.</p><p>A number of Zanu PF political bigwigs lost in the primaries. Faz was blamed for their defeats.</p><p>Tapfumaneyi was instrumental in the formation of Faz in 2010 under the then Ministry of State for Presidential Affairs led by former State Security Minister Didymus Mutasa.</p><p>To cover up its mission and activities, Faz officials a small group of young students and members of faculty at Solusi University near Bulawayo founded the organisation to access business and empowerment opportunities then being offered under the government’s Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Programme.</p><p>This is just a disguise. Faz is a CIO front organisation run by Tapfumaneyi.<br>Faz was registered as a trust under the then ministry of State for Presidential Affairs before the ministry was dissolved in 2015.</p><p>Its founding trustees included Dr Bongani Ngwenya, who was the chairperson but is now in South Africa, Kudakwashe Mavula Munsaka, Kudzaiishe Mangidza and Gillian Shambare.</p><p>Other founding trustees were Fungai Jonga, who is now in Spain, Trinity Mashava (Dubai, UAE) and Winfilda Chirango (Australia). </p><p>Other people involved are Samson Mangozhe, Brighton, Ruvimbo Tambara and Linda Manda who are in France and South Africa.</p><p>Tapfumaneyi has even reportedly put his wife Jessica, a Zanu PF member, and son Valentine Fidel in Faz. Jessica wants to be MP for Zvimba South constituency.</p><p>When the ministry of State for Presidential Affairs was dissolved in April 2015, Faz went dormant, but maintained its mission and structure as a CIO front organisation.</p><p>On 12 August 2022, Faz Trust submitted an application for affiliate status to Zanu PF in terms of section 16 (2) of the party constitution under Mnangagwa’s instruction to justify getting involved in the party’s affairs.<br></p>""",https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/organizations/forever-associates-zimbabwe,b4dc06cc48b0e06857fbad08c9198551

Also known as ‘Burma’, Myanmar has struggled with internal conflict since the mid-20th century: after it gained its independence from the UK in 1948, Myanmar entered a period of political transition that saw several ethnic groups vying for control and often engaging in violent conflict. Myanmar’s military junta took control of the country in 1988 and has subsequently been accused of numerous human rights violations and the political oppression of opponents. The actions of the Burmese government have prompted a collective response from the international community and a range of economic sanctions measures. Notable sanctions programs against Myanmar are enforced by the US, the EU, the UK, Australia, and Canada and include measures such as arms embargoes, trade embargoes, asset freezes, travel bans, and investment bans. To ensure compliance with Myanmar sanctions, firms should be familiar with the relevant restrictions applicable in their jurisdiction.<br></p><p class=\""MsoNormal\""> <strong>Myanmar Sanctions: US</strong></p><p class=\""MsoNormal\"">The United States implemented sanctions against Myanmar in 2003, imposing a ban on imports from Myanmar, a ban on financial service exports to Myanmar, asset freezes on Burmese financial institutions, and travel bans on Burmese officials. The US imposed another round of sanctions in 2007, with asset freezes on a further 25 senior officials, and the authorization for asset freezes on any individuals deemed responsible for human rights abuses in Myanmar. </p><p class=\""MsoNormal\"">While the US has eased some Myanmar sanctions since 2007, it has also expanded and added new restrictions in response to ongoing human rights abuses and acts of political oppression. In 2021, President Biden imposed new restrictions in response to a military coup d’état against Myanmar’s democratically elected government.

Its foremost mission is the protection of the Danu populace, paving the way for a federal democratic union to flourish. With unwavering dedication, the DPLF/DPLA aspires to establish the Danu State, an embodiment of democracy and human rights, while confronting Bamar chauvinism, military dominance, and narrow nationalism.</p><p>The DPLF/DPLA's journey commenced with a transformative decision. Seeking military training, its members embarked on a pivotal expedition to the Nyi-Naung Ethnic Armed Forces on August 7th, 2022), culminating in the official proclamation of the DPLF/DPLA nearly a year later on July 29th, 2023.<br></p><p>Amidst the backdrop of constitutional designations, Pindaya and Ywangan townships in Shan State have been demarcated as the <strong>Danu Self-Administered Zone</strong>.

United by a shared yearning for freedom from oppression, the DPLF/DPLA has taken up the mantle of liberating the Danu people from their subjugated existence.</p><p>Embodying the vibrant tapestry of Shan State's ethnic diversity, the DPLF/DPLA finds common cause with groups such as the 'Wa' (UWSA), Ta’ang (TNLA), Mongla (MNDAA), Shan State Progressive Party (SSPP), and the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS). Beyond established entities, newer forces like the Pa-O National Defense Force (PNDF) and Southern Shan State Generations have risen in response to the prevailing circumstances following the military coup.</p><p>The heart of the Danu people beats across the landscapes of Shan State, their presence felt from Naung Cho and Lawksawk to Pindaya, Ywangan, Kalaw, and Taunggyi. Yet their influence extends beyond these boundaries, reaching into Mogok, Pyin Oo Lwin, Thazi, Kyaukse, Nyaung-Shwe, Yangon, and Mandalay.

But teak imports into America are prohibited by US sanctions imposed in response to the violent military coup in Myanmar. In this updated and expanded version of our December 2022 report Acts of Defiance, we name 12 major American timber firms which have nevertheless been importing teak from Myanmar since the start of the 2021 coup.</p><p>Since US sanctions were imposed on 21 April 2021, payments to (either directly or indirectly), or the receipt of goods from, MTE are prohibited. Additionally, US dollar payments to a sanctioned individual or entity are prohibited, as a transaction in US dollars will pass the through the US financial system and cause the bank executing the transaction to violate sanctions. MTE requires auction participation fees and payment for teak to be made in US dollars. This provision applies to both US and non-US individuals and entities. All Myanmar teak is by default illegal under US sanctions, therefore, there is a de facto ban on the teak trade. </p><p><strong>12 US-based companies were responsible for Myanmar teak imports into America</strong></p><p><strong> US Company \""Myanmar teak imports since 2021 coup (tonnes)\""</strong></p><ol><li><strong><a href=\""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/east-teak-fine-hardwoods\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">East Teak Fine Hardwoods</a> 1,357.95</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\""https://www.mcilvain.com/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">J.

Meanwhile, the Japanese International Co-operation Agency (JICA) – Myanmar’s largest source of official development assistance (ODA) – are expecting demand for electricity to multiply fivefold to 15 gigawatts (GW) by 2030.</p><p>At the end of January 2018, the Myanmar government announced that it will begin importing liquified natural gas to help meet the growing energy demands of the country. The government has stated that there are three LNG projects in the pipeline. The proposed LNG plants are located in Kanbauk in Tanintharyi Region, Mee Laung Gyaing in Ayeyarwady Region and Ahlone in Yangon Region. The government is hoping that half of these projects will be operational by mid-2020. These powerplants, in addition to the natural gas project in Kyaukphyu in the Rakhine state is expected to raise Myanmar’s generation capacity by 3,100 MW. With the construction of these plants, the total electricity generated in Myanmar is set to go up to 6,000MW, double from the current 3,000 MW generated.<strong> But after the coup seized the country many of the investors have halted their projects. </strong></p><p>1. <strong>Mee Lin Laung LNG Terminal </strong>(Proposed)</p><ul><li>Owner: <a href=\""https://www.zhefu.cn/en/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Zhefu Holding Group Co.

4092,o-0abe73ff27,,Mutapa Investment Fund,Financial institution,2015-01-01,"""<p>Mutapa Investment Fund is a Sovereign Wealth Fund. Current Assets for Mutapa Investment Fund is $97,500,000.</p><p>It was established by an act of parliament in 2014 called Sovereign Wealth Fund Act.</p><p>In September 2023 it was renamed to Mutapa Investment Fund to through Statutory Instrument 156 of 2023, by President <a href=\""https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/people/p-d49bbd7c1f-emmerson-dambudzo-mnangagwa/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Emmerson Mnangagwa</a> using the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures Act).</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>The origins of our sovereign wealth fund are from a mining sector policy study conducted in 2012 that recommended the establishment of the fund to drive long-term investment leveraging on mining, natural and other resources that would anchor inclusive economic growth and development. The SWF was formed in by Parliament 2014. The stated purpose of the fund was to make secure investments for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations of Zimbabweans, to support the development objectives of the government including its long-term economic and social development, to support fiscal or macro-economic stabilisation and to supplement government revenue. The fund became inactive.</p><p>The Sovereign Wealth Fund of Zimbabwe was a financial entity established by the government of Zimbabwe to manage and invest surplus funds generated from the country’s natural resources, such as minerals and commodities. Its primary objective is to preserve and grow national wealth for the benefit of current and future generations. The fund was designed to diversify Zimbabwe’s economy, promote sustainable development, and provide a buffer for economic shocks. It typically invests in a range of assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and infrastructure projects, both domestically and internationally.</p><p>The original Sovereign Wealth Fund was designed to build up a portfolio of State-owned investments for the benefit of future generations. These could be in companies owned entirely by the State, or in joint ventures with outside or private shareholders.</p><p>Because sovereign wealth funds are created ostensibly to secure investments and safeguard natural resources for the benefit of future generations citizens, their conduct and operation call for greater scrutiny and the creation of strong checks and balances to ensure sound corporate governance and avoid fund mismanagement, looting and abuse.</p><p><strong>Change Process</strong></p><p>The Government shareholding in a large block, with assets worth billions of dollars, of 20 State-owned companies was transferred to the Mutapa Investment Fund, the upgraded and renamed Sovereign Wealth Fund. This block will be overseen by the Minister of Finance and Investment Promotion, with a board of 10 members.</p><ul><li>The board consists of the top two staff, the chief executive and the chief investment officer, plus eight other members, including the chairperson, appointed by the President after consulting the Finance Minister.</li><li>Members need to be people of recognised integrity, have proven competence in finance, investment, economics, business management or law, and represent the diversity of the peoples and communities of Zimbabwe. The board also has to be gender balanced.</li><li>Members of Parliament cannot sit on the board given their oversight role, and neither can those with criminal records. Half the board need to be men and half women, with the chairperson and deputy chairperson of different genders.</li></ul><p><strong>Shares</strong></p><p>The shares held by the Government of Zimbabwe (whether in the name of the Government or on its behalf by any named Minister or Ministry) in the 20 listed companies became vested in Mutapa Investment Fund and form part of the initial capital of the fund without any transfer, conveyance or other instrument, reads the regulations. Within 21 days, the shareholder register of the 20 concerns will need to show the change, and the 20 entities will need to deliver to the fund’s chief executive officer the appropriate share certificates issued in the name of the Mutapa Investment Fund. The Fund has been found to be necessary in any economy as a way of ensuring inter-generational equity such that current wealth can be passed on to future generations.</p><p>It will become more handy given the country’s endowment with its natural resources such as gas, lithium, gold among others. The Fund will also be used as a way to create the Government balance sheet to put value to State assets.</p><p>Key features include the allocation of funds towards fulfilling the Fund’s objectives and the ability to invest surplus funds. Shares held by the government in listed companies would become part of the Fund’s initial capital. The Fund is authorized to transfer various funds in and out of Zimbabwe. However, tax obligations must be fulfilled before any transfers take place. In exceptional cases of financial difficulties, the <a href=\""https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/organizations/reserve-bank-of-zimbabwe/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe</a> may impose temporary restrictions on Fund-related payments or transfers on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.</p><p>The Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) has controversial privileges, including the ability to move foreign currency out of Zimbabwe, (see the Gold Mafia) raising concerns about transparency and accountability. Critics argue that President Mnangagwa bypassed parliamentary powers and failed to involve necessary debate. They also highlight the government’s lack of understanding regarding the role of a sovereign wealth fund in diversifying the economy. Concerns exist about the profitability of state-owned enterprises transferred to the MIF and the need for economic reforms. The government’s use of statutory instruments without parliamentary involvement is criticized for undermining democratic processes and transparency. </p><p>The Vesting of Shares of these Companies in the Mutapa Investment Fund was stated under the Fourth Schedule (Section 14 (4)).

4095,o-cff1f99e0a,,The Long Bay development,Other,,"""<p>Long Bay (长湾) is a property development located in coastal Koh Kong Province, in Koh Sdach Commune, Kiri Sakor District. It is located within a broader development zone called Dara Sakor, now branded ‘Coastal City’ (or 七星海, Qixinghai, in Chinese). The area was leased by the state to Union Development Group (UDG) in 2008, which has since brought in other investors to develop specific locations in the vicinity. The Long Bay project was envisioned as a luxury resort covering 200 hectares including commercial streets, a cultural tourism area, sea-view apartments, villas, a yacht marina, a casino, and a coastal hotel. It also includes a 55-hectare ‘smart industrial park’. At the ground-breaking ceremony of the project in November 2018, the company’s executive director predicted an ‘80,000 industry and tourist population’ growing within five years. As of September 2022, the project is only partially developed.</p><p>Long Bay sits at the centre of the massive 450-square-kilometre (45,000-hectare) development zone that was granted between 2008 and 2011 to Chinese company Union Development Group (UDG, 优联发展集团有限公司), a subsidiary of Tianjin Youlian Investment Development Group (天津优联投资发展集团有限公司). The project designs have changed over the years, as has its name. From its inception the project was known as Dara Sakor, but subsequently acquired the name Coastal City in English and 七星海 (Qixinghai) in Chinese. For more information on the broader development at Dara Sakor, see this comprehensive profile in The People’s Map of Global China. Although it came into existence five years before the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was first announced, it was subsequently absorbed into the Initiative and later included in a list of ‘Key Projects of Production Capacity and Investment Cooperation’ jointly signed by China and Cambodia in 2016, as well as a list of priority projects agreed by the two government in 2019.</p><p>The Dara Sakor development was controversial from the outset, largely due to its connection to extensive eviction and resettlement of entire villages of fisherfolk and farmers that resided within the area, as well as encroachment on to the Botom Sakor National Park. Media reports have found that over 1,100 families were pushed off their land and more than 1,500 homes dismantled. Years of protest, negotiations, and rounds of compensation followed, and some disputes continue to simmer. UDG was sanctioned by the US Government in 2020 under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, due to its connections to serious human rights abuses, including these evictions. For more discussion on the background to these sanctions see the profile in The People’s Map of Global China.</p><p>Despite being granted well over a decade ago, only a small percentage of the Dara Sakor zone has been developed. While it is presented by UDG as a unified development, it is in fact being developed by several actors. For example, the Long Bay area appears to have been sub-leased or sold to Zhengheng Group (more below). Another development covering 248 hectares within the area called Stardream Lake Tourism Town (星月湖) was also announced in 2020. The plan for this area is to build hotels, villas, and casinos, but UDG is seeking investors to purchase or rent plots of land within the zone to develop them. In the plan shown below, Long Bay sits in Zone 2 ‘Qixinghai International New Zone’.</p>""",https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/organizations/the-long-bay-development,c7b22812c6c3369e6e0a0ca77f89105c

It was wholly owned by the government. Its main objective was stipulated as being the sole procurer of fuel and petroleum products in the country. The company was also mandated to store and distribute such products to oil companies in the countries such as BP, Shell and Total amongst others.</p><p>In 2002, the company entered into a partnership agreement with Tamoil Trading (based in Libya), as a means to curtail fuel shortages which began to be rampant in the last quarter of 1999. Mr Amos Midzi who was the then Minister of Energy and Power Development was credited for bringing about this lucrative deal whose proceeds remain obscure. This saw the re-branding of the company informally into Tamoil Zimbabwe. The deal was short lived and they were erratic supplies of fuel and petroleum products. During this time, the company had incurred debts amounting to about US$345.</p><p>In 2011, the company was divided into two companies with separate duties.

It also released a two-page statement strongly depicting the Rohingya issue as a matter of security. Apart from offering the usual rhetoric, and more importantly, the statement explicitly castigated the NLD for the ongoing prosecution of the controversial monk U Wirathu and portrayed the ruling party’s actions as harmful to Buddhism.</p><p>Ma Ba Tha emerged on Myanmar’s political scene in June 2013; its stated aim was to defend Buddhist Myanmar against alleged Islamization. By August 2015, it had successfully promoted the drafting and passage of four anti-Muslim laws on race and religion. In the run-up to the country’s November 2015 national elections, Ma Ba Tha monks positioned themselves against Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD and promoted incumbent President U Thein Sein’s public persona as the defender of race and religion, or Buddhism. But Ma Ba Tha’s blatantly political use of religion failed, as the NLD won the elections in a landslide.</p><p>During its initial months in office, the NLD tried to engage with Ma Ba Tha and encouraged it to tone down its anti-Muslim rhetoric and activities, but this effort failed. The NLD therefore had Ma Ha Na first warn Ma Ba Tha about the organization’s ‘illegality’ as a monastic association in July 2016 and eventually ban it in May 2017. Defying the Ma Ha Na’s order, Ma Ba Tha rebranded itself as the Buddha Dhamma Parahita Foundation and then largely vanished from the political scene, apart from the movement’s vocal poster monk U Wirathu.</p><p>During the celebration of Myanmar’s independence on 4 January, 2023, the junta leadership bestowed Ashin Wirathu, a Bhuddist Monk and nationalist extremist, the title of “Thiri Pyanchi” for “outstanding work for the good of the Union of Myanmar.” Not surprisingly, this sparked widespread controversy both in print and social media platforms.

Private bus companies also ran lines throughout the city at a smaller scale. Of the 7,800 buses registered in Yangon, 4,000 of them plied the streets of Yangon daily, covering over three hundred bus lines.</p><p>The main reason for the overhaul of the bus network was the increasing number of complaints against bus operators for compromising passengers' safety in a bid to maximise profits, with bus drivers driving dangerously to pick up more commuters than their competition.

Limited public information on their finances and activities has led to confusion amongst the many actors involved in managing and overseeing SEEs, including the general public.</p><p>SEEs range in size and function. Some take the form of financial institutions, others are licensing and regulatory agencies, and still others produce goods and services. There is little consistency as to what constitutes a state-owned economic enterprise in Myanmar, and this definitional vagueness has contributed to inconsistency in government policy and regulation of SEEs.</p><p><strong><a href=\""http://www.mod.gov.mm/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Ministry of Defense</a></strong></p><ul><li><a href=\""https://web.archive.org/web/20120902152646/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-east-asia/burma-myanmar/231-myanmar-the-politics-of-economic-reform.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Myanma Economic Holding Limited (MEHL)</a></li><li><a href=\""https://web.archive.org/web/20120902152646/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-east-asia/burma-myanmar/231-myanmar-the-politics-of-economic-reform.pdf\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Myanma Economic Corporation (MEC)</a></li><li><a href=\""https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/myanmar/industry.htm\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Myanma Directorate of Defense Industries (DDI, KaPaSa)</a></li></ul><p><strong><a href=\""https://www.moi.gov.mm/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Ministry of Information</a></strong> </p><ul><li><a href=\""https://www.moi.gov.mm/npe/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">News and Periodicals Enterprise</a> - subsidiaries agencies: <a href=\""https://www.moi.gov.mm/km/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Kyemon (The Miror)</a>, <a href=\""https://www.gnlm.com.mm/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Global New Light of Myanmar</a>, <a href=\""https://www.moi.gov.mm/mal/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Myanmar Alinn (Light of Myanmar)</a>, <a href=\""https://mdn.gov.mm/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Myanmar Digital News</a>, <a href=\""https://mrtv.gov.mm/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Myanmar Radio and Television (MRT)</a> and <a href=\""https://www.myanmaritv.com/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Myanmar International Television (MITV)</a> </li></ul><p><strong><a href=\""https://www.monrec.gov.mm/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (MONREC)</a></strong></p><ul><li> <a href=\""https://www.mte.com.mm/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE)</a></li><li> No. 1 Mining Enterprise - Plays a significant role in more than 40 minerals and metals including - cadmium, mercury, copper, iron, antimony, zinc, chromium, aluminium, lead, arsenic, silver, coal, tellurium, graphite, nickel, glass sand, magnesium, limestone, manganese dioxide, barite and decorative stone.

4157,o-64e6585c5d,,7 NCA-EAOs Alliance,Ethnic armed organization,2024-03-17,"""<p><strong>Background:</strong></p><p>The PPST, a coordinating body for NCA signatories, met in Chiang Mai from March 17 to 18 for what was dubbed the summit of the 7 EAO Signatories. During the meeting, the coordinating body established a secretariat that will be led by RCSS Chairman Yawd Serk. A statement issued by the summit organizers echoed earlier procurements released by the group including its “overarching goal” of “Establish[ing] the Federal Democratic Union for Myanmar.”</p><p>Since the coup, the KNU, CNF, RCSS, and NMSP have all sent letters of resignation to the PPST (although the total resignation process is convoluted and difficult to define). In particular, the KNU, CNF, and ASDF have reduced their level of participation in the group.</p><p>Despite this, Yawd Serk not only attended the meeting, but was named chairman of the new secretariat. Some NMSP representatives attended the meeting as well, while the newly formed NMSP-AD fought against the Myanmar military in Mon State this week. NMSP’s Nai Aung Min was appointed as deputy to the new secretariat. Notably, both DKBA and KNU/KNLA-PC were present at the summit. Khun Okkar attended as a patron of PNLO, but Chief of Staff of the PNLA Khun Thurein told The Irrawaddy that Khun Okkar attended “without the consent of the central executive committee.” A faction of the ALP—including Colonel Khaing Kyaw Hlaing and Saw Mra Raza Lin—also attended the event, although the ALP disagrees over which faction truly represents the organization. Former LDU member Kyar Solomon—who was suspended from the group in 2022 along with fellow attendee Kya Yar Ko—was included at the summit, but a statement from the EAO reiterated that Kyar Solomon does not represent the LDU and has abused the group’s name. Former KNU Chairman Mutu Say Poe and Myo Win—who was suspended from ABSDF this year—attended the summit as well. </p><p>The new summit highlights the ongoing fragmentation within the PPST as well as within the EAOs themselves. In his opening speech at the Summit, Yawd Serk said political and military affairs are shifting daily. “The current situation is dynamic and fragile. At the moment, the political boundary is getting narrower and the military boundary is getting wider. The seven NCA-S EAO will continue to uphold federal principles and move forward towards that goal. The seven NCA-S EAO will start to practice their own administration in the territories that they control.” </p><p>It’s still unclear how this “rebranding” effort will impact the overall context and whether this will ultimately change the groups’ relationship with the SAC’s “peace talks.” This is especially key to note, given the “representatives” at this meeting have frequently visited Naypyidaw since the military seized power. Notably, the summit made no official comments about the SAC’s conscription law.</p><p><strong>Current Secretariate Members:</strong><br></p><ol><li><a href=\""https://sapphire.envisageworldwide.com/people/p-54b2e2d6a5-yawd-serk/\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""noopener\"">Gen.
